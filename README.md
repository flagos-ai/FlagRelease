# FlagRelease
FlagRelease is an innovative project built on FlagOS, a specialized "operating system" designed for large models and optimized for heterogeneous chip-based computing clusters. FlagOS efficiently manages and schedules computing resources in multi-chip environments, delivering robust foundational support for the training and inference of large language models (LLMs).

As a unified large model release project for various AI hardware architectures, FlagRelease is designed to simplify the deployment of large models across different AI hardwares. It is suitable for both research and production environments, helping users bypass all the distributed environment settings, dependencies, and unique configurations for specific chips. The system provides unified software source code, verified model files, and all-in-one docker image for each chip, which can be directly applied to the hardware. Additionally, evaluation results on these chips are offered as technical reference.

Meanwhile, the source code of FlagRelease project is publicly available. We weclome collaborative intelligence and contributions from global developers.
